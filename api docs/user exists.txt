 authentication
Check User Exists
get /auth/exists

Checks if a user by a given username, displayName or email exist. This is used during registration to check if a username has already been taken, during change of displayName to check if a displayName is available, and during change of email to check if the email is already used. In the later two cases the excludeUserId is used to exclude oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.

It is REQUIRED to include AT LEAST username, displayName or email query parameter. Although they can be combined - in addition with excludeUserId (generally to exclude yourself) - to further fine-tune the search.
