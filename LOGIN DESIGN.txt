1.

We need a log in page that handles a 2fa login flow.

The pages should always forward the cookies to the API endpoints

There should username and password fields.
When the user puts in the data it should use the /auth/user 'api docs/login auth.txt'
endpoint to go to the next step of the login flow.

if we get a user object back, we are now logged in. display the object for the user.
if not, we will get a 2fa request then we should present a 2fa text field for the user to use.

they can then submit to the 'api docs/2fa.txt' endpoint

Login failed. Status code: 403, Message: {"error":{"message":"\"please identify yourself with a properly formatted user-agent containing application name, version and contact information. thank you!\"","status_code":403,"waf_code":13799}}

"rain-1 vrchat-friend-list v2"



3.

User Information

        {'requiresTwoFactorAuth': ['totp', 'otp']}
    

logout 


In the function login()

if we get a status_code 200

and the response JSON looks like this:
{'requiresTwoFactorAuth': ['totp', 'otp']}
(if it contains 'totp')

then we should do the 2fa log in part. It's not a 401 that triggers that logic.
